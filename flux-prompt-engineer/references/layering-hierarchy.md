# Layering and Hierarchical Structure

## Layered Compositions

FLUX.1 allows you to define placement of objects in foreground, middle ground, and background. This creates depth and visual complexity.

### Structure Pattern

```prompt
[Subject description]

Foreground: [Close elements with most detail]
Middle ground: [Main action or focal points]
Background: [Context, atmosphere, distant elements]

[Overall mood/atmosphere]
```

### Examples

**Simple layering:**

```prompt
A hanging glass terrarium featuring a miniature rainforest scene with colorful orchids and tiny waterfalls (foreground). Just beyond the glass, a neon sign reads 'Rainforest Retreat' in bright green and yellow letters (middle ground). The rain-soaked glass creates a beautiful distortion, adding a soft glow to the sign's vibrant colors (background).
```

**Complex layering:**

```prompt
Create a bustling marketplace in a fantastical floating city.

Background: Depict a city of interconnected floating islands suspended in a pastel sky. The islands should have a mix of whimsical architecture styles, from towering spires to quaint cottages. Show distant airships and flying creatures in the background.

Middle ground: Focus on the main marketplace area. Illustrate a wide plaza with colorful stalls and shops selling exotic goods. Include floating platforms that serve as walkways between different sections of the market.

Foreground: Populate the scene with a diverse array of fantasy creatures and humanoids. Show vendors calling out to customers, children chasing magical floating bubbles, and a street performer juggling balls of light. In the immediate foreground, depict a detailed stall selling glowing potions and mystical artifacts.

Atmosphere: The overall mood should be vibrant and magical, with soft, ethereal lighting that emphasizes the fantastical nature of the scene.
