```

## Color Palette

```prompt
A neon sign reading 'Rainforest Retreat' in bright green and yellow letters against a dark background, with a soft glow effect.
```

**Color harmony tips:**

- Complementary: opposite colors for high contrast
- Analogous: adjacent colors for harmony

```

**Common effects:**

## Example: Complex Text Integration

```prompt
A retro 1950s diner exterior at dusk. The main focal point is a large neon sign reading 'ROSIE'S DINER' in cursive cherry-red letters with a bright pink glow effect. Below in smaller Art Deco sans-serif font: 'Open 24 Hours' in electric blue. The chrome and glass facade reflects the neon colors. Shot on Canon EOS R5 with 50mm lens, f/2.8, capturing the warm glow against the deepening twilight sky.
