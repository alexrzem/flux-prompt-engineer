# Technical Parameters and Camera Settings

**Note:** Effectiveness varies by FLUX model, LoRAs, and training data. These are experimental techniques.

## Camera Devices

Different cameras produce different looks and feels.

| Camera | Best for | Style |
|--------|----------|-------|
| iPhone 15 | Casual, modern, everyday shots | Social media, relatable scenes |
| Canon EOS R5 | Professional high-detail images | Landscapes, portraits, product shots |
| Sony Alpha 7R IV | High-resolution, rich textures | Nature, architecture, close-ups |
| Polaroid | Vintage, nostalgic shots | Retro, artistic scenes |

**Example:**

```prompt
A vibrant orange and pink sunset over a snow-capped mountain range, shot on a Canon EOS R5, capturing the vibrant colors and sharp details of the scene.
```

## Lenses

Control field of view and depth of field.

| Lens | Length | Best for |
|------|--------|----------|
| Wide-Angle | 16-35mm | Landscapes, cityscapes, large interiors |
| Standard | 50mm | Portraits, natural perspective, bokeh |
| Telephoto | 70-200mm | Close-ups, wildlife, subject isolation |
| Macro | 100mm | Extreme close-ups, details, textures |

**Example:**

```prompt
A portrait shot with a 50mm lens, capturing the subject's face in sharp focus with a softly blurred background.
```

## Settings

### Aperture (f-stop)

Controls light and depth of field.

- **Low f-stop (f/1.4 - f/2.8)**: Blurred background (bokeh), shallow depth
- **Medium f-stop (f/4 - f/8)**: Balanced sharpness
- **High f-stop (f/11 - f/22)**: Everything sharp, deep depth

### ISO

Controls light sensitivity.

- **Low ISO (100-400)**: Bright scenes, minimal noise
- **Medium ISO (400-800)**: Normal conditions
- **High ISO (1600+)**: Low light, adds grain/noise

### Shutter Speed

Controls motion capture.

- **Fast (1/1000s+)**: Freezes motion
- **Medium (1/60s - 1/250s)**: Everyday shots
- **Slow (1s - 30s)**: Motion blur, light trails

**Example:**

```prompt
A night cityscape with skyscrapers, neon signs, and car light trails, shot with f/8, ISO 100, and a 30-second shutter speed, capturing the city lights with sharp details and minimal noise.
```

## Shot Types

Frame the scene correctly.

- **Wide-angle shot**: Expansive view, landscapes
- **Medium shot**: Focused area, portraits
- **Close-up shot**: Details, textures, expressions
- **Aerial/bird's eye**: Top-down perspective
- **Bug's eye view**: Ground-level looking up

**Example:**

```prompt
A wide-angle shot of a mountain range at sunrise, capturing the expansive landscape with vibrant colors and sharp details.
```

## Combining Parameters

```prompt
A professional portrait of a woman with flowing red hair, shot on Canon EOS R5 with 85mm telephoto lens, f/2.8 for creamy bokeh, ISO 200 in soft natural window light, 1/250s shutter speed. The shallow depth of field isolates the subject against a softly blurred urban background, emphasizing her striking green eyes and subtle smile.
