# See-Through Materials and Textures

FLUX.1 can create images with transparent materials and complex textures that add depth and realism.

## Transparent Materials

### Glass

Creates distortion, refraction, and reflections:

```prompt
A neon sign reading 'Rainforest Retreat' visible through a rain-soaked glass window. The glass creates a beautiful distortion, adding a soft glow to the sign's vibrant colors.
```

### Ice

Crystalline structures with internal reflections:

```prompt
A majestic mountain peak emerging through swirling morning mist, with golden sunrise light catching the crystalline ice formations.
```

### Water

Refraction, ripples, and transparency:

```prompt
A glass of water on a wooden table, with light reflecting off the surface of the glass. The glass is covered in tiny water droplets, and the table has a rough, textured finish.
```

### Plastic/Acrylic

Smooth, glossy, with subtle distortions:

```prompt
A futuristic display case made of clear acrylic, showcasing a glowing holographic object inside. The acrylic surface shows subtle fingerprint smudges and light reflections.
```

## Textures and Reflections

### Surface Textures

**Rough textures:**

- Weathered wood grain
- Cracked concrete
- Textured fabric weave
- Rusted metal surfaces

**Smooth textures:**

- Polished marble
- Glossy ceramic
- Brushed aluminum
- Silk fabric

### Light Interactions

**Reflections:**

```prompt
A modern office building with floor-to-ceiling glass windows reflecting the golden sunset and surrounding cityscape. The reflection is sharp in some areas and distorted in others due to the curved glass panels.
```

**Refractions:**

```prompt
A crystal prism on a white surface, splitting incoming sunlight into a rainbow spectrum that projects colored bands across the background.
```

**Condensation/Droplets:**

```prompt
A cold glass of iced tea on a summer day, with condensation droplets streaming down the outside. Each droplet magnifies the blurred background, and the table beneath shows a ring of water.
```

## Complex Material Combinations

```prompt
A hanging glass terrarium filled with moss and miniature plants, suspended by thin copper wire. Behind it, a vintage neon sign glows in pink and blue. The glass creates layered distortions: first the plants inside, then the transparent walls with small air bubbles frozen in the glass, and finally the softly blurred neon glow beyond. Water droplets on the outside catch highlights from the neon. Shot with Sony Alpha 7R IV, 85mm macro lens, f/4, emphasizing the multiple layers of transparency.
```

## Atmospheric Effects

### Fog/Mist

Creates depth and mystery:

```prompt
A dense forest scene with morning mist weaving between ancient trees. The fog is thickest in the middle ground, with trees emerging as dark silhouettes, while the foreground shows detailed ferns with dew droplets.
```

### Smoke

Dynamic, flowing transparent forms:

```prompt
A stick of incense burning on a meditation altar, with curling smoke rising in delicate tendrils. The smoke catches light from a nearby window, creating translucent shapes against the darker background.
```

### Underwater

Refracted light and particle suspension:

```prompt
An underwater scene looking up toward the surface from 10 feet down. Sunbeams penetrate the water creating god rays, with suspended particles visible in the light columns. A snorkeler's silhouette is visible above, distorted by the water's surface.
```
